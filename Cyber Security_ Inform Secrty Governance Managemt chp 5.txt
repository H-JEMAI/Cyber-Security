//Cyber Incident Response 

it's a high-level organized actions to be taken in response to a security incident or event


//Security Incidents
  if an incident matters 
    How we respond?
    How we react?
    How we recover?
  early planning  minimizes risk and decreases response time
 Security Events and Incidents
   -Event : Any observable occurrence in a system or network
   -Adverse Event :Any event that has negative consequences
   -Incidents:An imminent threat of violation, or a violation itself, of a security policy, or 

standard security practice

    Not every event is an incident, but every incident contains at least one event
    Security Team (CSIRT)

//Incident Response Teams
   members can be  permanent or temporary and  are cyber security professionals
   Leader is a skilled Incident Responder
   Subject matter experts
   IT support staff
   Legal counsel
   Human resource staff
   Public relations and marketing staff
  
 testing the Team
  Plans without testing are ineffective
     teams must be trained  and ready for an incident response
     testing provide amelioration the policy and procedures and playbooks
     testing can include pentesting to simulate a real attack



//Incident Response Phases

*Preparation
•Takes preparation to build a well-prepared CSIRT (Computer Security Incident Response 

Team)
•Requires proper policy foundation within the organization
•Preparation includes building proper cyber defenses in the organization  
•Digital forensic devices
•Forensic software
•Packet capture devices
•Spare servers ,network gear
•Backup devices
•Blank removable media
•Collection, analysis, and reporting devices
•Office supplies
•devices for collection detection and analysis
•Hardest to standardize
•Tool s help in detection, but it takes a trained analyst to understand all the details during 

analysis
•When detection occurs, analysts shift to validation mode, then into analysis
•Primarily passive activities designed to uncover and analyze incident 
*Detection and Analysis:
   Event Indicators
     • Alerts
     • IDS/IPS, SIEM, Anti-virus, or other applications alerts
     • Logs from any device or network flow
     • public information 
     • people suspicious activity report  


   Best Practices for Analysis
  •Profile networks and systems
  •Understand the baseline
  •Create good logging policies
  •Conduct event correlation
  •Synchronize network and system clocks
  •Maintain organization knowledge base
  •Capture network traffic ASAP in incident
  •Filter information to reduce confusion
  •Know when to bring in outside help

* Containment, Eradication,  and Recovery
  •stop the spread of the incident,remove it  and recover from it
  •Phase focuses on active detection and removal of the incident

  (5 Steps)
    1.Pick containment strategy
    2.Use strategy to limit the damage caused by the incident
    3.Gather evidence needed for potential future legal actions
    4.Identify attacking system or attacker
    5.Remove effects of incident and recover business 

*Post-Incident Activity
        •CSIRT isn’t done once the incident is contained and eradicated,
    they still needto conduct:
        •Event reconstruction  : 
              Recreate a timeline of the incident ,Conduct consultations with  administrators 

and managers
        •Lessons learned : 
              What happened and when?
              How did staff perform?
	Were procedures followed?
	Were procedures adequate?
	What should have been done differently?
	Was information shared effectively?
	How could we detect incident sooner?
	What new tools or resources does the organization need?
	Evidence retention
          •Evidence Retention    
               What do we do with it large quantities of evidencecollected 
                Most organizations maintain records for 2 to 3 years if there is not a law case.

//Incident Response Policy and Procedures
   *follow the program or plan approved by the compagny
   * should be timeless
Contents of the Policy
•Statement of management commitment
•Purpose
•Objectives
•Scope of policy
•Definitional terms
•Roles, responsibilities, and authority
•Incident prioritization scheme
•Measures of performance for CSIRT
•Reporting requirements
•Contact information

incident Response Procedures
•Detailed information
•Step-by-step guidelines
•Not a replacement for CSIRT’s (Computer Security Incident Response Team)professional 

judgement and expertise
•Often developed as a specific playbook

Playbook?
•Describes a response to a high severity type of incident, such as:
   • Data breach of financial information
   • Data breach of personally identifiable information
   • Phishing attack against customers
   • Web server defacements
   • Loss of corporate laptop
   • Intrusion into the corporate network
   • Windows Golden Ticket reset
   • incident Response Checklist  NIST SP 800-61
       http://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-61r2.pdf

//Communication and Information Sharing

//Incident Classification
  incidents should be classified by their threat and severity 
     threat  : umproper usage/lost or theft eaquipement/APT/other 
     severity:  NIST 800-61
  Allows comparison of current incident with past and future ones
  Aids in personnel’s understanding of the incident being worked on
 

//Network Event Monitoring
   Network event analysis  common task to detect or prevent incidents
   Network flows  data flow and devices status
   use of Network flows standards
    active and passive monitoring

//Network Monitoring Tools
   wireshark/solarwinds/catci/prtg/nagios

//Detecting Network Events
      determine an incident based on events
      using log analysis determine if an event will become an incident

       Types of Network Events:
 	Beaconing 
	Unusual bandwidth consumption
	Link and connection failures
	Unexpected traffic


//Network Probes and Attacks
        ports scan/DoS/DDoS/
        rogue devices: a hard added to the network 
        solution: MAC adress validation/network access control and port security 

// Server and Host Events
 * monitoring 
 * central management like SIEM for analysis 
 * blacklist software/files/ also certain tools used by hacker and useful too by IT admins
 * whitelist app
 * ACL
 * rights and permissions

//Service and Application Events
      Services and Applications should be monitored following  ITSM processes
	Are they up/down?
	Are they responding properly?
	Are they functioning properly?
	Are they conducting transactions properly?
	Are they logging properly?
     Service Anomalies
	Non-security issues:
	Authentication errors
	Permission issues
	Services don’t start on boot up
	Service failures
	Investigate the issue to ensure it is not security related
	Use antivirus, antimalware  file integrity check, and whitelisting verification

       Check service Status
       Check service Interruption
       Check memory Overflows

//Digital Forensics

-Forensics are used to determine any changes, activities, or actions that have occurred on 

a host or server
-Allows incident responders to determine what occurred by putting together various 

pieces of information
-Similar techniques are used by incident response teams and law enforcement

//Forensic Toolkit Components
   use clean hard drives and well prepared before use 
   document and label network devices and their drivers and make a check list

//Mobile Forensic Toolkits
   Specialized software for accessing mobile devices

//Forensic Software
  * data collection and analysis using forensic tools


//Training and Certification
   full time forensic admins should be trained and certified

//Forensic Investigation Process
   Determine what you want to find out
   Determine location to find that info
   Document your plan
   Acquire/preserve the evidence needed
   Perform initial analysis (log actions)
   Conduct deeper analysis (log actions)
   Report on your findings

// Disk Imaging
    * create drives image ,hashes, saving data integrity 
    * cloning disks with bit-by-bit copy
        linux command    # ddbs-64k if=/dev/disk1/sda1 of=/mnt/usb1/sda1.img
     *encrypt drives

//Incident Containment
   Perform this as quickly as possible
   Isolate the issue
   Stop the spread of the incident
   Coordinate with stakeholders taking actions
   Segmentation of the network to to prevent spread from one part of network to another

   Containment objective : limit damage,provide repair issue ,maintain normal business
   identify the hackers is another issue and take time if business is ok  mauy be its no    

need

//Eradication and Recovery
   Remove any artifacts of the incident
   Restore the network to full function
   Correct any security deficiencies
   Remove malicious code, clean compromised devices and fix affected  accounts
   reconstruct the system from storage backup
   rescan and patch any hard /soft  may be weak for the same attack vector

    validation effort : check user accounts /permissions/systems logging/vulnerability 

scans 


//Finishing the Response

   management Process:
      make changes  to management Process 
      make changes  to management emergency board
      ensure all changes have been documented properly
      ensure that network diagrams and vulnerability scan profiles updated
   Lessons-Learned :
     make the incident details documented the cause and the security solution
     make discussion and changes needed

//   Final Report
     Every incident should finish with a compiled written report
     Established organizational “memory”
     Can serve as documentation in case further legal action occurs in the future
     Can identify other deficiencies in the incident response that need to be dressed by admins
   
  Final report includes 
	Timeline of incident and response events
	Root cause of incident



//////////////// part 2


because the question deals with patch  we use a scenario leading to that
  

the scenario : a worm and Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) Agent Infestation   

a worm transmitted over the network it is spreading through hosts and copy itself to windows shares and install a DDoS agent

the actual antivirus dont detect this new worm 

until abnormal behavior alarm is declared by SIEM machine learning 

the cyber admin team make a first diagnostics  and they found that several machines are supposed to be infected 

the info alert is broadcasted to all staff (also to  stakeholders )in order to apply the procedure.
 Broadcast to all departements 

an urgent  meeting at high level is set with cyber trusted comitee to discuss the event 

at the same time the IT team proceed to react with response plan

the cyber team should answer to theese questions

What sources of evidence
How would the evidence be acquired
Where would it be stored
How long should it be retained
How would the incident response team identify all infected hosts
How would the organization attempt to prevent the worm from entering the organization before solutions recovery or patch 

if the compagny try to patch all vulneranle hosts how would it be done
How would the handling of this incident change if infected hosts that had received the DDoS agent had been configured to attack another website next time
How would the handling of this incident change if one or more of the infected hosts contained sensitive personally identifiable information regarding the compagny's employes
 How would the incident response team keep the compagny's  users and customers informed about the status of the incident
What additional measures would the team perform for hosts that are not currently connected to the network

is there a third-Party  to the compagny  should be included in the compagny Incident Response Program 
the event  is nowobservable ,is has another negative consequence
is the event make a threat  of a security policy or to the standard security

may be other questions will be faced  


following to the incident reponse plan and the suggestions of the cyber comiteethe reaction toward the worm in this case is applied




Network segmentation, Windows share ports will be blocked to temporality prevent propagation of infection



gathe data logs from all devices and stored off line to perform evidence collection
  
Asset management and patch management systems are in place and will be used to ensure that all hosts on the network are scanned

vulnerable machines would be patched via the patch 

management system and would follow patch management procedures currently in place

Prioritization would change to include notify of the other organization and implementation of firewall rules to prevent network communication

Notification to employees of the possible exposure of PII (Personally Identifiable Information)would be handled by the HR departementt

The compagny will follow the BCP (business continuity plan)communication procedure to continue to inform impacted employees

IT/HR communications as well as blocking connection from remote teleworkers until patches have been verified 

Each department should consider the potential impact of the incident scenario and document the necessary action steps that will be taken during the incident. 

if necessary trusted third party can be included in compagny Incident Response Program

BEFORE MAKING PATCH 

Gather inventory on all server, storage, switch, router, laptops, desktops, etc. on the network and distributed throughout the organization. Inventory can be gathered manually or through automated discovery tools.

Once you’ve completed an inventory and categorization, create a test lab environment that mirrors your production environment. Test lab environment should try to replicate the 

applications that you will use to test current patch updates.


 After completing the testing in  lab environment  the staff should create a full backup of any data and any configurations setup within environment. 

Implement Configuration Management

After  backups have been created and all lab patches tested, any changes to the production environment should be proposed and documented in the Configuration Management (CM) tool. If we experience any challenges during the rollout, we can refer to the CM tool for reference.

Roll out  the Patches to Production
Document the  Patch Management Process

Consider the root cause of the incident so that the system isn’t susceptible to the 
same attack vector again

Verify PATCH  effectiveness by testing
